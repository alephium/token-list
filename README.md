## Token metadata example

https://github.com/alephium/token-list/blob/master/tokens/mainnet.json#L4-L11

* All of the token logos should stay in the folder `logos` with the same naming as the token symbol
* The token uri in the token metadata should use the Github logo uri: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephium/token-list/master/logos/<symbol>.png`
* The token uri will be available once your PR is merged to `master` branch
